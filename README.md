# üóÑÔ∏è Simple In-Memory SQL Engine in C++

This is a lightweight, in-memory SQL-like database engine written in **C++**. It supports basic SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying with filtering logic. Ideal for learning how SQL parsing and execution works under the hood.

## ‚úÖ Features

- üß± Create tables with any number of columns  
- üìù Insert rows of string data  
- üîç Select all or specific columns  
- üß† Filter rows using `WHERE` clause  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Logical operators supported: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`  
- üß™ Simple command-line interface for testing  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Tables are stored in-memory using C++ `unordered_map`.  
- Each table has:
  - A name
  - A list of columns (`vector<string>`)
  - A list of rows (`vector<Row>`)
- The engine parses commands like:
  - `CREATE TableName col1 col2 ...`
  - `INSERT TableName val1 val2 ...`
  - `SELECT [cols...] TableName [WHERE col op val ...]`
- Supports filtering using simple conditions with `=` operator.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Compilation

### Requirements:
- C++11 or higher  
- GCC or compatible compiler  

### Compile:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o sql_engine main.cpp
üöÄ Usage
After compiling and running the executable, you‚Äôll see a prompt:

shell
Copy code
SQL>
From here, you can enter SQL-like commands to interact with your in-memory database.

To exit the program, type:

sql
Copy code
exit
üßæ Supported SQL Syntax
Create a Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TableName Column1 Column2 Column3 ...
Example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE Students ID Name Age City
Insert Data into a Table
sql
Copy code
INSERT TableName Value1 Value2 Value3 ...
Example:

sql
Copy code
INSERT Students 1 Alice 21 NewYork
Select All Columns
sql
Copy code
SELECT TableName
Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Students
Select Specific Columns
sql
Copy code
SELECT Column1 Column2 TableName
Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name Age Students
Select with WHERE Condition
sql
Copy code
SELECT TableName WHERE Column = Value
Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Students WHERE Age = 21
Select with Multiple Conditions
sql
Copy code
SELECT Column1 Column2 TableName WHERE Column1 = Value1 AND Column2 = Value2
Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name Age Students WHERE Age = 21 AND City = NewYork
Using OR and NOT
sql
Copy code
SELECT Students WHERE Age = 21 OR City = Boston
SELECT Students WHERE NOT Age = 21
üß™ Example Session
sql
Copy code
CREATE Students ID Name Age City
INSERT Students 1 Alice 21 NewYork
INSERT Students 2 Bob 22 Boston
INSERT Students 3 Charlie 21 NewYork

SELECT Students
SELECT Name Age Students WHERE Age = 21
SELECT Students WHERE Age = 21 AND City = NewYork
SELECT Students WHERE NOT City = Boston
üöß Limitations
Only the = operator is supported in WHERE clause (no <, >, !=, etc.)

Data is not stored persistently (memory only)

No support for advanced SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)

All values are treated as strings

Simple line-based command parser

üîÆ Future Improvements
Add support for more operators: <, >, !=, etc.

Implement persistent storage (e.g., save/load to files)

Add UPDATE, DELETE, and ALTER functionalities

Improve error handling and validation

Introduce support for multiple data types (int, string, etc.)

Build a command history and auto-completion feature
